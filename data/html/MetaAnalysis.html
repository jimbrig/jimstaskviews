      <p>
        This task view covers packages which include
   facilities for meta-analysis
   of summary statistics from primary studies.
   The task view does not consider
   the meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD)
   which can be handled by
   any of the standard linear modelling functions
   but does include some
   packages which offer special facilities for IPD.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard meta-analysis model is a form of
  weighted least squares and so
  any of the wide range of R packages providing
  weighted least squares would
  in principle be able to fit the model.
  The advantage of using a specialised package is
  that (a) it takes care of the small tweaks necessary
  (b) it provides a range
  of ancillary functions for displaying
  and investigating the model.
  Where the model is referred to below it is this
  model which is meant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where summary statistics are not available
  a meta-analysis of significance
  levels is possible.
  This is not completely unconnected with the problem
  of adjustment for multiple comparisons but
  the packages below which offer this,
  chiefly in the context of genetic data,
  also offer additional functionality.

          The primary studies often use a range of
    statistics to present their
    results.
    Convenience functions to convert these onto a common
    metric are presented by:
<a href="../packages/compute.es/index.html">compute.es</a>
          which converts from
    various statistics to
    d, g, r, z and the log odds ratio,

          which converts to mean differences,
    and
<a href="../packages/metafor/index.html">metafor</a>
          which converts to effect sizes
    an extensive set of measures
    for comparative studies (such as binary data,
    person years, mean differences and
    ratios and so on), for studies of association
    (a wide range of correlation types), for non-comparative
    studies (proportions, incidence rates, and mean change).
    It also provides for a measure 
    used in psychometrics (Cronbach's alpha).

          provides
   a range of effect size calculations with partial overlap

   for converting test statistics, also includes a

          or producing a CSV file.
<a href="../packages/effsize/index.html">effsize</a>

        Standard methods outlined above assume that
    the effect sizes are independent.
    This assumption may be violated in a number of ways:
    within each primary study multiple treatments may
    be compared to the same control,
    each primary study may report multiple
    endpoints, or primary studies may be clustered
    for instance because they come from
    the same country or the same research team.
    In these situations where the outcome is multivariate:
      </p>

        Meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic tests
      </h4>
      <p>
        A special case of multivariate meta-analysis
    is the case of summarising
    studies of diagnostic tests.
    This gives rise to a bivariate, binary
    meta-analysis with the within-study correlation
    assumed zero
    although the between-study correlation is estimated.
    This is an active area of research and a variety
    of methods are available
    including what is referred to here as Reitsma's
    method, and the hierarchical summary receiver operating
    characteristic (HSROC) method.
    In many situations these are equivalent.
